## Add your button to css-buttons

1. Add your HTML code in the [index.html](https://github.com/Design-and-Code/css-buttons/blob/main/index.html) file.
2. Add your CSS code in the [buttons.css](https://github.com/Design-and-Code/css-buttons/blob/main/buttons/buttons.css) file.
3. Make sure you do not change any other button's code.
4. For naming css classes use the correct naming conventions - eg. yourname-btn-index or btn-yourname-index.
5. When you open the PR, please include a full screenshot.
6. See below demo code to know how to add your button.

#### Demo code 
```html
    <!-- your-github-username-btn-1 start -->
    <div class="button-container">
            <!-- add your buttons here, eg.-->
            <button class="{your-github-username-btn-index}">
                <span class="{your-github-username-btn-index}"> Example Button </span>
            </button>
            <div class="createdby-section">
                Created by
                <a href="{your-github-link}">{your-github-username}</a>
            </div>
    </div>
    <!-- your-github-username-btn-1 end -->
```
> So it will look like this 
```html
    <!-- Rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1 start -->
    <div class="button-container">
            <!-- add your buttons here, eg.-->
            <button class="rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1">
                <span class="rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1-span"> Example Button </span>
            </button>
            <div class="createdby-section">
                Created by
                <a href="link">Rajkumar-justcoder</a>
            </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1 end -->

```
7. Also if u use any tag like span or div etc then your should have class-name like this: `your_github_username-btn-index-span/text/div` (example: `rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1-span`) as u can see in above given demo code.
8. If using keyframes/animation in css then keyframe name also should be like this: `your_github_username-btn-index-rotate` (example: `rajkumar-justcoder-btn-1-rotate`)

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in css-buttons, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes
the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

- Add appropriate title and description to your issue.


#### Things to keep in mind while reporting a bug

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

- What is your environment?
- What steps will reproduce the issue?
- What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
- What would you expect to be the outcome?
- Provide adequate screenshots/log for the bug.

All these details will help developers to fix any potential bugs.
